# Elements

## Symbol
*A symbol is a tangible element that will share the same exact form as any other abstract elements related to it.*

**Smallest denominator:** It is the smallest denominator that can represent a thing, fact, phenomenon, or any tangible concept.
**Deterministic:** It is implicitly deterministic.
**Unbound from context:** It receives a context only upon its application, meaning that it does not carry within itself any self-referential information.
**Unmutable:** It is not mutable by acts foreseen by the theory.
**Responsive:** It can express different texts depending on its application.

## System
*A system is an abstract element that derives from the symbol's form and is realized when it groups one or more symbols together.*

**Set:** Is a symbol that contains symbols.
**Contextualization:** It attributes meaning to one or more contained symbols by application.

## Consumer
*A consumer is an actor that performs an invocation of a symbol.*

## Feature
*A feature is an abstract element that derives from the symbol's form and is realized when it defines the text a symbol will express upon application.*

## Invocation
*An invocation is an act that consists of applying a symbol for the purpose of acquiring its expressable text or attributing context to it.*
